## User Feedback on GitHub Actions Quickstart Guide

While the guide on GitHub Actions is instructive, I found the section on naming the workflow file a bit unclear. The distinction between the file name and the necessity for a specific extension was not immediately apparent. I suggest the following improvements for this section:

- Explicitly state that while the name of the `.yml` or `.yaml` file can be user-defined, the extension itself is crucial and should be chosen correctly to ensure the workflow runs as expected.
- Add a note explaining the importance of the `.github/workflows` directory and how GitHub Actions uses this specific path to locate workflow files.
- Provide a brief explanation or tooltip on why the `.yml` and `.yaml` extensions are both acceptable and what `YAML` stands for, to give beginners a better understanding of the file format used.
